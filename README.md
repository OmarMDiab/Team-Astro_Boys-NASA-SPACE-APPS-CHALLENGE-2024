# Seismic Waves Detection App ðŸ”­

Developed for **NASA Space Apps Challenge** by Team **Astro Boys**

Welcome to the Seismic Waves Detection App! This tool is designed to simplify the process of detecting and analyzing seismic waves, especially the precise P-wave arrival time, which is key in fields like seismology and earthquake research. Built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, this app makes seismic data analysis accessible and interactive, right from your browser!

## How It Works?

Once you upload the file, the app will display file details right away so you can confirm that everythingâ€™s good to go.

From there, the app guides you through these steps:

- At each stage, the app offers visualizations so you can see exactly whatâ€™s happening to your data

### Filtering the Signal

Youâ€™ll start by applying a high-pass filter that cleans the raw data by removing unwanted noise.

### Envelope Extraction

By applying a Hilbert transform, the app captures the envelope of the waveform, making it easy to spot significant features.

### Anamoly Detection

Here, youâ€™ll see peaks highlighted directly on the signal envelope, with the app doing the heavy lifting to detect them for you.

### Clustering of the anomalies

Using K-means clustering, the app groups the peaks and displays the densest cluster visually, so you can zoom in on the most relevant wave segments.

### Outlier Detection and Removal

The app automatically removes outliers in the densest cluster, ensuring the P-wave detection is as accurate as possible.

### P-wave Detection time

Finally, the app marks the P-wave arrival time on the original signal, helping you pinpoint it with confidence.
